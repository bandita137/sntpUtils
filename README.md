ntpserver
=========

A Python based ntp server.

Tested on Linux, Windows 7 and 10.

Based on ntplib(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ntplib/), thanks for their work.

Original work is at [limifly/ntpserver](https://github.com/limifly/ntpserver).
If you have any question, please contact me at limifly@gmail.com.

Code was heavily modified by Gregory Kuhn/[mentaal](https://github.com/mentaal/sntpUtils/tree/logging) 
(Python 3, server/client, error injection, logging and command line parameters) and 
András Széll/[bandita137](https://github.com/bandita137/sntpUtils) 
(backported to Python 2 keeping Python 3 compatibility, linux bugfixes).

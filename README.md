ntpserver
=========

A Python based ntp server.

Tested on Linux and Windows7.

Based on ntplib(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ntplib/), thanks for their work.

If you have any question, please contact me at limifly@gmail.com.

Code was heavily modified by Gregory Kuhn/mentaal (Python 3, server/client, 
error injection, logging and command line parameters) and 
András Széll/bandita137 (backported to Python 2 keeping Python 3 
compatibility, linux bugfixes).
